# Developer User Groups Engagement Survey (Singapore) (May 2021)

## Introduction

Given these unprecedented times, it has been a challenge to continue running user group meetups. This survey aims to find out what has been working, what to avoid and how we can do better. Your response will help meetup groups better organise themselves to engage you, the target audience. I will be sharing this with the meetup group organizers (and you can also request a copy of the survey results).

If you have any questions about this survey, you can contact me on Twitter: @coderkungfu. Or email me at: mcheng dot work at gmail dot com

### Question 5: What did you like about the meetup group events you have attended so far?

- The interaction after the talks
- Discussions
- Able to learn and share/ask questions about the talk/workshop live
- Planning the speakers
- Online Meetups are quite convenient, can join from anywhere.
- Common topic
- Q&A, diversity
- Get to know people
- Physical presence and interaction
- Talking to people
- To be coding together, not just ‚Äúsit and watch.‚Äù
- Content and interactions
- People I know
- Community
- Friendly people like you, Michael! Learn something about technologies that I care about.
- Useful information. Online meetups are also convenient to attend.
- Less attendees, smaller groups with regular attendees make it easier to make personal connections than in person meet up
- i didn't like any of them and stopped attending altogether
- Learning through interaction
- Social aspect
- Quality content
- Seeing people's faces on camera.
- Collaboration, participation, facilitation
- Real info
- Sit and watch. Easier to get new knowledge.
- knowledge and experience sharing, case studies

### Question 6: What did you NOT like about the meetup group events you have attended so far?

- Puzzle games, zoomba
- People tend to be too shy to speak up
- Sometimes the session is too long, more than 1hr... prefer shorter session with a bit of time to interact/social chats
- Planning the speakers
- Nothing beats in person Meetups.
- Quiet after a while
- People turned off camera and lack of engagement
- Vendor sponsor talk
- Seminar style
- Lack of interaction among attendees
- If the presenter went too fast
- Too many dominant speakers or just one person
- Feel distance from the presenter
- Presentations seem a bit unengaging / boring / too long
- Most participants at tech meetups are quite distant and not interested to socialize.
- Harder to interact with speakers and other attendees
- too many people with a few dominating people, no opportunities to connect with others spontaneously as with in-person meetups
- Nothing
- Things that can be watched later
- No audience engagement
- Promotion‚Ä¶.
- Lots of time eating sub activities
- people are shy to interact. It's harder than in a face to face environment
- not targeted (since audience group can be big) and hence irrelevant and wasting time.

### Question 7: Do you have any ideas on how we can improve or do differently?

- Need to have a more active asynchronous forum
- Consolidate user group meeting of the same languages eg. Across region or across relevant and complementary languages. Have mix of talk and workshops from - diverse presenters
- Pre-recorded videos if the session doesnt need live interactions
- Have time for social or games or just to talk about how folks are going abt their lives now and help each other out
- More informal chats.
- It takes a person to keep feeding into the group; needs to be sustainable.
- For smaller group, throw an ice breaking question to warm people up and start engagement before the talk.
- More cross-community crossover talks tied by a common quarterly theme (think of it more like TV-series in DC-universe have crossover episodes once a year)
- Still looking for ideas too
- There seem to be fewer meetups these days. Consider have a series of meetups for a topic like 3-parts how to build a xxx
- Pre-record, shorter, more discussion
- Maybe it's possible for participants to open rooms with topics for others to join and talk. And anyone can switch rooms as they need?
- more federation probably- it's only possible to build meaningful connections in smaller groups
- Keep online option for those unable to be present
- Just come together online to discuss things (social), don't need to do things together that can be done async like watching a video
- ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
- Good question üòÇ workshop jug ?
- It's good already
- I've attended an awesome conference called "wild card conference". They used Remo, which allows to have a virtual break room in which people can interact - before the talks. It worked well.
- perhaps be more targeted and short (within 1h).

### Question 9 (for Meetup Organiser): What format has been working for you?

- Live streaming as part of a concerted effort works somewhat.
- For example, the GDG regional event that we did with various other meetup groups saw more interest. The month of IWD events with Developer space also had - higher interest as well
- Consistency, we had a lot of success during CB with workshops and meetups but numbers are quite Low again. Most of the engagement is related to non WP - stuff like SEO and marketing rather than dev topics
- Online via Zoom
- Talks and discussion
- Online
- Telegram chat, Zoom presentations.
- Online. Preso or workshop followed by discussion
- Ad-hoc spontaneous get togethers
- Zoom
- Short time based presentation
- ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüòî
- Obs
- Zoom, YouTube,
- Social chit chat
- To be honest I haven't been very active organizing meetups, but small group of less than 10 where everyone knows everyone else seems to be the most - comfortable.
- 45 minutes
- Collaborative facilitated
- Covid times online, but in person was also great.

### Question 11: Any other comments about developer user groups in general?

- Gather.town or virtual kopi.JS can or not?
- What does this group do?
- They are great for my mental health. ‚ù§Ô∏è
- Id love to learn more from other groups
- Better moderation pls
- Appreciate the effort to organize meetups and keeping community alive
- Out of many active groups I personally feel DSSG did strong in community management, organizer onboard, and maintained a high engagement level. Hope they - share their experience with local community leaders.
- Go pre-recorded
- Things are sliding off and people have zoom fatigue, the current format doesn‚Äôt work for us anymore
- I'm a developer but I find developer events extremely boring.
- Tougher to get more members to participate.
- Thanks for doing this, Michael. Covid will be with us for some time, so we need to find a way forward.
